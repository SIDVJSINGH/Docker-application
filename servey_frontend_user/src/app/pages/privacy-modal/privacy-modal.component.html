                                    <p>Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same person about whom we

                                    information you have previously provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request you submit, we may ask you
                                    to
                                    provide certain information so that we can match the information you provide with the information we already have on

                                    may contact you through a communication method (e.g., phone or email) that you have previously provided to us. We may
                                    also

                                    verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional

                                    information as soon as we finish verifying you.</p>

                                    <p>"Financial incentive" means a program, benefit, or other offering, including payments to consumers as compensation, for
                                    the
                                    disclosure, deletion, sale, or sharing of personal information.</p>
                                    <p>The law permits financial incentives or a price or service difference if it is reasonably related to the value of the
                                    consumer's data.
                                    A business must be able to explain how the financial incentive or price or service difference is reasonably related to
                                    the value of
                                    the consumer's data. The explanation must include:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>a good-faith estimate of the value of the consumer's data that forms the basis for offering the financial incentive or
                                        price or
                                        service difference; and</li>
                                        <li>a description of the method the business used to calculate the value of the consumer's data.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>We may decide to offer a financial incentive (e.g., price or service difference) in exchange for the retention, sale, or
                                    sharing of a
                                    consumer's personal information.</p>
                                    <p>If we decide to offer a financial incentive, we will notify you of such financial incentive and explain the price
                                    difference, as well as
                                    material terms of the financial incentive or price of service difference, including the categories of personal
